Duke CompSci 308 Cell Society Project

*Start Date: September 15th

*End Date: the morning of October 3rd

*Collective amount of time spent: About 165 hours

*Resources: We went to Professor Duvall's office hours to ask a few design questions (how to format and handle the grid) and how he recommended dealing with exceptions, especially with the xml files and loading those into the program.
We also utilized the readings that have been a part of the course to help frame how we wanted to design our program.
For random, specific questions we had, we utilized places such as Stack Overflow and other websites to iron out the issues.

*Files used to start the program: The Main class under the main package.

*Files used to test the project: All of the following files are included in the resources package: BadInputFile.xml, Fire.xml, FireSpecific.xml, ForagingAnts.xml, GameOfLife.xml, GameOfLifePulsar.xml, PredatorPrey.xml, Segregation.xml, Sugar.xml, Sugar2.xml. We used each of these files to test simulations or throwing errors when an incorrect file had been loaded.

*Any data or resource files required by the project: In order to get the correct text for the buttons and some of the other text in the program, you will need the English.properties file included in the resources package.

*Any information about using the program/Cheat Codes: Currently, we have it where the program automatically loads ForagingAnts. When the user wants to load another simulation, they can choose the 'Load XML File' button to load in their selected XML file. If the user would like to stop the simulation at any time, they can choose the 'Pause' button and then click the 'Play' button when they would like to restart the simulation. The 'Step' button allows the user to see the simulation step-by-step, if they are interested to see how the cells interact with each other at a slower level. The slider at the top left of the screen allows the user to speed up or slow down the simulation.

*Any known bugs, crashes, or problems with the project's functionality: None that we are aware of.

*Any extra features included in the program: All of the different simulations include sliders to the right of the grid that allow the user to alter the values for each parameter. Additionally, there is a graph at the bottom of the screen that allows the user to see key interest points for the simulation (such as number of cells burning or containing trees for the fire simulation). The graph is useful to see how the changing of parameters is changing the overall simulation.

*Our impressions of the assignment to help improve it in the future: Overall, we enjoyed the assignment, especially after we were able to see it all come together in the final project. We wish we had learned about MVC in class more in depth before we began the plan so we could have a better grasp on how to design the project. We had a basic idea of what MVC was when we were creating the plan, but very few ideas on how it would be implemented, so it became more difficult to create a cohesive, logical plan with those gaps in our knowledge. Additionally, we learned a lot from going over a few of the key design patterns in class on Tuesday. We thought it would have been helpful to at least have been introduced to those and the website before we began coding Cell Society to have a better grasp on some of the key design features. On a more specific level, one of the more confusing design challenges we faced included enums. Although we had discussed in class that enums were great if used correctly, we still weren't sure on the specifics of what constituted 'good' and 'bad' use of enums.
